It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, remove, and play files. The listAllFiles
method prints a list of the collection.

Lab 4#
21. calling listAllFiles() does indeed print the 3 files i've inputted in 
addFile(String filename)
22. x
23. with the breakpoint set on the loop body of listAllFiles(), the 
debugger shows that the method will print a file every time once it passes 
the loop body, and then it goes back to the beginning
